  # The 'name' value must be unique.
  # The 'class_path' points at a Python stacker "blueprint" class.
  - name: touch-nothing

    # in this case, if you look in the "blueprints" directory at the file "touch.py"

    # when we execute stacker with this `stack config`, it will automatically run the
    # blueprint code to produce a CloudFormation JSON template, upload it to s3, and
    # trigger a CloudFormation create/update.
